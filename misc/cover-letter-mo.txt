I am excited to apply for the Senior Engineering Manager role at Monzo. With years of experience leading engineering teams and scaling high performance software systems, I bring a strong blend of people leadership, technical credibility, and delivery focus.

At Intel (Codeplay Software), I currently lead 18+ engineers across four Agile teams, including senior, principal engineers and tech leads. I define and deliver technology roadmaps, coach senior engineers into leadership roles, and drive performance management and HR transitions, all while fostering an inclusive, high performing culture.

Highlights of my experience include:

* Leading 4 Agile teams (18+ engineers), including senior and principal engineers, to deliver AI/HPC optimisation projects aligned with Intel’s product strategy.
* Coaching senior engineers into leadership roles, strengthening succession planning and team scalability.
* Driving division-wide OKR creation, reporting and delivery processes, improving transparency and alignment across engineers in the company.
* Co-chairing an open-source SIG under the Linux Foundation, influencing cross vendor adoption and technical standards.

I am drawn to Monzo’s mission driven, autonomous squads and would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience in scaling teams, guiding technical direction, and delivering outcomes in complex, high growth environments.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the chance to discuss how I can contribute to Monzo’s continued success.
